This repo is based on the [tutorial](https://ewanvalentine.io/microservices-in-golang-part-1/) provided by Ewan Valentine. This project is intended to gain practice in developing Mircoservices in golang and familiarity with various technology such a gRPC. Extension to the tutorial will be documented.
